# Microsemi SmartFusion or SmartFusion2 Cortex-M3 based board
#
# Use this script when targeting any SmartFusion or SmartFusion2 based board
# when only on-chip ESRAM/ENVM are used. If off-chip memory is used and
# the program is to be downloaded to this then refer to one of the
# other example board scripts provided instead. In the latter case the script
# may need to configure the external memory before the debugger can download
# the program.
#
# Usage examples:
#   --command "set DEVICE M2S050" --file board/microsemi-cortex-m3.cfg
#   -c "set DEVICE M2S150" -f board/microsemi-cortex-m3.cfg
#   -c "set DEVICE A2F200; set JTAG_SPEED 2000" -f board/microsemi-cortex-m3.cfg
#
# DEVICE *must* be specified as the relevant 6 character device name:
# SmartFusion:  A2F060, A2F200, A2F500
# SmartFusion2: M2S005, M2S010, M2S025, M2S050, M2S060, M2S090, M2S150
#
# JTAG_SPEED *may* be specified (in kHz) and defaults to 2000 (i.e. 2MHz) 
# if not specified.
